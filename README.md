# Rip-Off Cut

- This is my attempt to build a clone of GNU coreutils 'cut' for [The Coding Challenges - Build Your Own cut Tool](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-cut/)
- To make it more challenging, I developed it with new programming language, Gleam which has released its v1.0.0 about a month ago. The reason I chose it because it:
  - is statically typed
  - has minimal features just like Go
  - is a functional paradigm (which I'm not familiar with)
- Well, I might be writing this language as recreational programming for now.
- [TESTING] This should reflect on parent repo when there is commit to current repo. The parent should update this by command `git submodule update`
